## Description
For this project, we were to create a user-friendly app for generating a professional README file to accompany any GitHub project. When writing a README such as this one, it can be difficult to figure out how to present a project and ensure all the appropriate information is included. This README, in fact, was created using this tool! No more multiple commits to create a nicely-formatted README file.
